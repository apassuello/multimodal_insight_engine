```bash
# Main test command
./run_tests.sh

# Test output
- HTML coverage report: coverage_html/index.html
- XML coverage report: coverage.xml
- JUnit test report: reports/junit-report.xml
```

Current test coverage requirements are set to a minimum of 40%.

## Code Style and Standards

The project follows:
- PEP 8 style guidelines (4-space indentation, 79-char line limit)
- Google-style docstrings
- Type hints for function parameters and returns
- Module-level docstrings that describe purpose and key components

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with specialized components
2. **Extensibility**: Base classes designed for easy extension
3. **Flexibility**: Configuration options for various use cases
4. **Hardware-Agnostic**: Support for different compute platforms (CPU, CUDA, MPS)
5. **Compositional Architecture**: Components can be combined in flexible ways

## Future Development Roadmap

1. Enhance multimodal fusion techniques
2. Expand safety evaluation framework
3. Improve documentation and examples
4. Increase test coverage
5. Add more pretrained model adapters
6. Implement additional tokenization strategies
