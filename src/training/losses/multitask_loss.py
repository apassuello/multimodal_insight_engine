"""MODULE: multitask_loss.py
PURPOSE: Implements a flexible multitask loss function that combines multiple task-specific losses with configurable weights.

KEY COMPONENTS:
- MultitaskLoss: Main class that aggregates multiple loss functions with weights
- Dynamic task weighting based on task difficulty or importance
- Support for various task types (classification, regression, contrastive)

DEPENDENCIES:
- PyTorch (torch, torch.nn)
- Logging

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Supports dynamic loss weighting strategies
- Can be extended with task-specific metrics tracking
- Designed for use in multimodal and multitask learning scenarios
