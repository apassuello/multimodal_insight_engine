Transformer Model Training Issues: Analysis & Resolution
Problem Summary
The neural machine translation model (EncoderDecoderTransformer) was not learning properly during training. Loss values remained extremely high (~8.9) and didn't decrease significantly with training, indicating the model was making random predictions.
Root Cause
The root cause was identified as a mismatch between the model's output format and what the loss function expected:
The EncoderDecoderTransformer class was applying softmax to its outputs in the forward and decode methods, returning probabilities
However, the LabelSmoothing loss function expected raw logits (pre-softmax values) as input to calculate loss correctly
Detection Process
The initial clue was the persistently high loss of ~8.9, which is suspiciously close to log(8005) (natural log of vocabulary size)
Loss not decreasing during training indicated no learning was happening
Our debugging script confirmed equal probability predictions (~0.000125) for all tokens, suggesting random outputs
This indicated the model was outputting uniformly distributed probabilities instead of learning meaningful patterns
Technical Details
The key problematic code was in the EncoderDecoderTransformer class:
Apply to translation_...
output
When we apply softmax and then compute cross-entropy loss (which LabelSmoothing does internally), we're effectively computing:
CrossEntropy(Softmax(logits), targets)
However, PyTorch's loss functions expect raw logits and apply softmax internally:
CrossEntropy = Softmax + NegativeLogLikelihood
So we were effectively applying softmax twice, creating uniformly distributed probabilities.
Solution Implemented
We modified the EncoderDecoderTransformer class to return raw logits instead of probabilities:
Removed the softmax application in the forward method
Removed the softmax application in the decode method
Updated docstrings to reflect that methods now return logits
Updated the generate method to apply softmax manually since it now receives logits
Why It Worked
After implementing the fix:
Loss started at ~9.1 and decreased to ~8.8 in the first epoch (showing learning)
By the third epoch, loss dropped to ~7.8, a significant improvement
The model began predicting correct tokens with higher probability than random ones
When applied to the translation example, loss decreased to ~2.47 with perplexity of ~11.85
The fix ensured that:
The model's raw logits (with meaningful differences between token predictions) were passed to the loss function
The loss function could properly calculate gradients based on these differences
The model could learn from its mistakes through effective backpropagation
Additional Improvements
We also made these enhancements:
Added an --epochs parameter to the translation training script
Added detailed debugging tools to diagnose training issues
Created visualization tools for loss history
Improved error reporting and analysis
Key Technical Lesson
Never apply softmax before cross-entropy loss. The two operations are designed to work together, with softmax being part of the cross-entropy calculation. Applying softmax separately breaks the loss computation and prevents learning

Implementation Checklist
When building neural networks:
Check your model architecture:
Ensure your model returns raw logits, not probabilities
Remove any softmax/sigmoid from the final layer if using cross-entropy loss
Review your loss functions:
Understand whether they expect logits or probabilities
Most PyTorch loss functions expect logits
Apply softmax only for inference:
Keep prediction and loss calculation separate
Only use softmax when you need actual probabilities
Real-World Example
In a transformer translation model, we found:
Apply to translation_...
output
Fixed version:
Apply to translation_...
calculation
After this change, the model's loss decreased properly during training, and the model started making meaningful predictions.
Conclusion
The "double softmax" problem is a common but often overlooked issue in neural network implementations. By ensuring you pass raw logits to your loss functions and only apply softmax when you need actual probabilities, you'll avoid this pitfall and ensure your models learn effectively.
Remember: Loss functions expect logits, not probabilities.
