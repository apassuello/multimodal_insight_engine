- **Thread safety**: Proper locking for multi-threaded access to shared resources.

### Recent Improvements
- **Enhanced caching system**: Implemented an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with time-based expiration to improve memory efficiency and performance.
- **Memory monitoring**: Added memory usage monitoring that automatically clears caches when system memory is constrained.
- **Input validation**: Added comprehensive input validation for all methods with detailed error messages.
- **Performance optimizations**: Improved batch processing with memory-aware batching and prepared framework for vectorized operations.
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensured all improvements maintain compatibility with existing tests and interfaces.

### Areas for Future Improvement
- **Full vectorization**: Additional performance could be gained by implementing full tensor-based processing for common operations.
